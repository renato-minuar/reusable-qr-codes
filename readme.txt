Create reusable QR codes with changeable destinations. Perfect for museums, retail, events, and anywhere physical QR codes need to stay relevant.

== Description ==

**The Problem:** You print QR codes, hang them up, and when you need to change where they point, you have to reprint and replace them. Expensive, wasteful, and time-consuming.

**The Solution:** Reusable QR Codes creates permanent QR codes that you can update anytime without reprinting!

= How It Works =

1. Create a QR Code and set a destination URL
2. Download and print/share the QR code
3. Visitors scan the code and get redirected to your destination
4. **Update the destination anytime** without reprinting the QR code!

The QR code contains a permanent link to your WordPress site, which then redirects to wherever you want. Change the destination as many times as you need - the physical QR code never changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need any external services or API keys? =

No! This plugin is completely self-contained and works entirely within your WordPress installation. No external dependencies, no API keys, no recurring fees for the free version.

= Can I really change where the QR code points without reprinting it? =

Yes! That's the whole point. The QR code contains a permanent URL on your site (like `yoursite.com/qr/museum-exhibit-1/`). When someone scans it, they're instantly redirected to whatever destination URL you've set. Change that destination anytime in WordPress.

= How many QR codes can I create? =

Unlimited! Create as many as you need.

= What formats can I download? =

PNG (high resolution 1024x1024px) and SVG (vector, scales to any size). Both are perfect for printing.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. The plugin is very lightweight and only loads assets when needed. The redirect happens instantly with minimal database queries.

= Can I use my own logo in the QR code? =

Not in the free version. This feature is available in the Premium version.

= Can I track how many times a QR code was scanned? =

Not in the free version. Analytics and scan tracking are available in the Premium version.

= Does this work with block themes? =

Yes! The plugin works with both classic and block themes.

= Can I display QR codes on the frontend? =

The free version is focused on backend management and downloads. Frontend display via shortcodes is available in the Premium version.

= What happens if I delete a QR code post? =

The QR code will stop working - visitors will see a 404 error. Only delete QR codes you're sure you don't need anymore.
